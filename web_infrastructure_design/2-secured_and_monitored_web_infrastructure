Three Server Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure Design for www.foobar.com
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Components:

- 1 Load Balancer (HAProxy)
  - Distributes traffic to backend servers using Round Robin algorithm.
  - Terminates SSL (HTTPS) using an SSL certificate.

- 2 Application Servers:
  - Each has:
    - Nginx Web Server
    - Application Server
    - Set of Application Files (Code base)
    - MySQL Database (1 Primary, 1 Replica)

- 3 Firewalls:
  - One in front of the Load Balancer (filters external traffic).
  - One in front of each Application Server (restricts internal access).

- 1 SSL Certificate:
  - Enables secure encrypted HTTPS traffic between users and Load Balancer.

- 3 Monitoring Clients:
  - Installed on each server (collect metrics and logs).
  - Send data to external service (e.g., Sumo Logic or Prometheus).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Explanation of Components:

- Firewalls:
  - Prevent unauthorized access to servers.
  - Enforce rules for incoming/outgoing traffic.

- HTTPS/SSL:
  - Encrypts data in transit.
  - Protects user credentials and sensitive data.

- Monitoring:
  - Collects logs, CPU usage, memory usage, and QPS (queries per second).
  - Used for debugging, performance tracking, and alerts.
  - Tools like Sumo Logic or Prometheus scrape or receive logs via agents.

- Monitoring QPS:
  - Use Nginx logs or MySQL performance schema.
  - Set up alerts if QPS exceeds a threshold.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Infrastructure Issues:

- SSL Termination at Load Balancer:
  - SSL is decrypted at the load balancer.
  - Backend traffic is unencrypted unless re-encrypted, which is a security risk.

- Single MySQL Primary Node:
  - Only one node can accept writes.
  - If the primary fails, manual failover or automation is needed.

- All-in-One Servers:
  - Each server runs Web + App + DB.
  - Not scalable.
  - Harder to isolate failures or scale parts independently.
